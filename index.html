    <h2>1. GILMORE GIRLS ★ ★ ★ ★ ★</h2>
    <p>
      Gilmore Girls is an American comedy drama television series created by Amy
      Sherman-Palladino, starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. The show
      debuted October 5, 2000 on The WB and became a flagship series for the
      network. The show ran for seven seasons, with the last being aired on The
      CW, and ended on May 15, 2007.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilmore Girls follows the lives of single mother Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren
      Graham) and her academically-minded teenage daughter, Lorelai "Rory"
      Gilmore, who live in the quaint, fictional town of Stars Hollow,
      Connecticut. Lorelai dreams of owning her own inn, and Rory plans to
      attend Harvard University.
    </p>
    <p>
      my opinion: this show started good but had a huge fall in season 4, when
      Rory graduated from Chilton and was supposed to attend Harvard which was
      her childhood dream, yet she went to Yale and this where things started
      getting complecated, but i like it so much especially season 2!! If you haven't seen Gilmore Girls yet, you better
      clear your schedule in order to watch the entire series — it will take you
      about 115 hours (five full days), and trust me, it's definitely worth it
    </p>
    <p>fav character: Rory Gilmore</p>
    <p>fav episode: season 2 episode 15 "Lost&Found" </p>

    <h2>3. A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</h2>
    
<p>A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of thirteen children's novels written by American author Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The books follow the turbulent lives of orphaned siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. After their parents' death in a fire, the children are placed in the custody of a murderous villain, Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance and causes numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee. As the plot progresses, the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society, which also involves Olaf and Snicket, the author's own fictional self-insert.</p>
<p>Since the release of the first novel, The Bad Beginning, in September 1999, the books have gained significant popularity, critical acclaim, and commercial success worldwide, spawning a film, a video game, assorted merchandise, and a television series. The main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages.[13][14] Several companion books set in the same universe of the series have also been released, including Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography, The Beatrice Letters, and the noir prequel tetralogy All the Wrong Questions, which chronicles Snicket's childhood.</p>
<p>my opinion: this series is amazing, filled with mysteries and unsolved plots, it causes a little trauma but its perfect for 10+ years old, not recommended for very young kids, and remmember to... LOOK AWAY</p>
<P> fav characters: Violet Baudelaire, Beatrice Baudelaire</P>
<p> fav episode: season 2 episode 3 & 4</p>
